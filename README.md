# DataMiningRDDProject
Association rules generation using RDB-miner algorithm

As part of our project, we implemented improved RDB Miner Algorithm on a bank database.We have a bank dataset that has 1030 tuples with 6 attributes â€“ CID, gender, job, education, institution and clvr.The bank management will be interested in attribute clvr, which is customer life time value.

So our application aims at finding association rules for clvr values, with other attributes, gender, job, education
and institution.
